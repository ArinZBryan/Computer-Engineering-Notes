### De Morgan's Theorem
Strictly, we don't actually need both $\text{AND}$ and $\text{OR}$. By De Morgan's theorem:
$A + B = (A' \cdot B')'$ and $A \cdot B = (A' + B')'$
### One More Operator
$\text{XOR}$ is not strictly a primitive operator, but it is used so often, that it is often treated as one. The symbol used for $\text{XOR}$ is either $\bigoplus$ or $\bigotimes$.
### Karnaugh Maps
A Karnaugh (sometimes called a K Map) map is another way of graphically representing logic circuits, aside from truth tables. By moving into the second dimension, the ability to simplify the circuits graphically is unlocked. If we extend all Karnaugh maps such that they tile in each dimension, then further simplification is doable.

> Most people would stop at 6-dimensional Karnaugh maps, as that becomes almost impossible to reason about.
##### Gray Codes
A Gray code is a sequence of binary numbers where each one differs only by one bit. It is important to note that they are used to label the axis on a Karnaugh map.
There is one Gray code for $n=2$ : $\{00, 01, 11, 10\}$. There is also one code for $n = 3$ : $\{000,001,011,010,110,111,101,100\}$. For $n \ge 4$, there are multiple valid codes.
##### Simplifying with Karnaugh Maps
To simplify with Karnaugh maps, group the cells in the map into (possibly overlapping) rectangles with side lengths that are powers of 2 (ie. 1, 2, 4 generally). Each of these groups can then be reduced to the minimal logic expression that results in those values. Finally, these expressions can be $\text{OR}$'ed together, and this might then be simplified manually, though this is harder to do (but still doable by hand).
##### X
When given a function that is defined as having an output of $\text{X}$, we can also include this in a Karnaugh map.

This allows for easier optimisation of the circuit, as any $\text{X}$ can be included in any groupings. So for the example above, a 2x2 square grouping can be made in the middle, and that is valid, as we don't care what that value is: if it's 1, then that's fine.
##### Sum of Products Form
Consider the function $Y = AB + BC$. We can use a Karnaugh map to simplify this down trivially to $Y = A'BC + ABC' + ABC$. Though this can be simplified into $Y = B(A + C)$, if we don't and just leave it as is, it will be in sum of products form. This may be desirable for one main reason when designing logic circuits in the real world: *gate delay*. That is, due to the fact that no matter what path the signals take, they will always go through the same number of gates. This means that, if the following circuits rely on timing, the time for this circuit can be ensured to be constant (assuming each gate in a layer has the same delay)
##### Product of Sums Form
By using the duality of $\text{AND}$ and $\text{OR}$, we can take any arbitrary statement in SOP form, and convert it to product of sums form.
