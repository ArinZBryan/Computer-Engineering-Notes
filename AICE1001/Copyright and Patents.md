### Copyright
Copyright is one of the types of intellectual property, and is granted to the authors of an original work of authorship automatically upon its creation. The copyright holder has a few rights:
- The right to reproduce their work
- The right to distribute their work
- Perform or display their work publicly
- Create derivative works based on the original
Copyright as a concept dates back to at the very least the 15th century, with the invention of the printing press. Within the UK, the Statute of Anne from 1710 was the first copyright law, pertaining to printed matter. Currently, the UK's copyright laws are governed by the Copyright, Designs and Patents act 1988.
