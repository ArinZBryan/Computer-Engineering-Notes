Software licencing is a legal process that governs the use and distribution of software. It involves granting permission to users to use the software under specific conditions and helps to protect the [IP rights](./Copyright%20and%20Patents.md) of the owners.
##### Licence Agreement
This is a legal contract between the licensor and the licensee that specifies how the software can be used, distributed and modified.
### Proprietary Licences
Many companies will want the general public to be able to use their software, but still want to maintain strict controls over the way it is used.
- **End-User Licence Agreement**: This is not so much a single licence, rather a style of licence, that generally govern the actions the user can take in regards to the software, and the licensor. The software remains property of the licensor and modification and redistribution are generally prohibited.
- **Subscription License**: This is a type of licence which is used when a company is charging a subscription for a project. The terms of the licence may often be similar to EULAs, or may include a separate EULA, which must also be followed.
### Open Source Licences
There are many times when you want to assert your rights over some software you have written, but you want to give users free and open access to the software created.
- **General Public Licence (GPL)**: This is a widely used free software license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, provided that any derivative works are also licensed under the GPL.
- **MIT Licence**: This licence allows users to do almost anything with the software, including moving it to another licence at the users' discretion.
- **Apace Licence**: Allows the user to freely use, modify and distribute the software, under some conditions to ensure proper attribution.
### Other Licences
- **Freeware:** Software that is distributed for free, but modification is restricted. Redistribution may also be restricted
- **Shareware**: Software that is provided initially for free, but with limited features or a time limit. To use the software further, a payment is required
- **Public Domain / Copyleft**: Software that is released into the public domain is free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute without any restrictions.
### Why Licence?
- Legal Protection - protection of your own rights and intellectual property in the case of misuse.
- Revenue Generation - earn money from your software from subscriptions and other licencing schemes
- User Clarity - make sure the user knows what they can and cannot do with your software so that it isn't misused.
- Encourage Innovation - licences such as the various open source licences, often encourage collaboration and innovation by providing building blocks for other developers to work on.
### Creative Commons (CC)
Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organisation that provides a set of free, easy to use copyright licences that enable people to share their work to the public with some, but minimal control over how their work is used.

The Creative Commons provides a base licence, that can be augmented with four major parts. The base licence is called CC0 (CC Zero), which gives users complete control over how and what they do with the work. The alterations are as following:
- **BY**: Credit must be given to the creator
- **NC**: Non-Commercial uses are the only uses permitted
- **ND**: No derivates or adaptations are permitted.
- **SA**: Adaptations must be shared under the same terms (like the GPL)
