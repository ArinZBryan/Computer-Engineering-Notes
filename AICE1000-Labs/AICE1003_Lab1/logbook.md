## Q5
```python
age = 42
print("Your age is", age)
if age > 17:  
    print("You are older than 17")  
    print("You can vote!")
else:  
    print("You are not older than 17")
    print("You cannot vote!")
print("Goodbye")
```
In English:
This code prints your age (hardcoded to 42), and if you are older than 17, it tells you that you can vote. No matter what, the program will always tell you goodbye when it is done.
