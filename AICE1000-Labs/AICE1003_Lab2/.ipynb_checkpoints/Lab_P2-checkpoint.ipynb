    "### 1.1. Aims and Learning Outcomes\n",
    "This laboratory aims to:\n",
    "- Understand loops and how to use them\n",
    "- Understand functions, how to define and call functions\n",
    "- Understand lists and operations on lists including list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you complete this laboratory, you will be to:\n",
    "- Write a simple program using loops to model repetitive behaviours\n",
    "- Write a program with functions to have better code structures with correct type annotations.\n",
    "- Utilise the list data structure and use operators to update lists.\n",

As such, it should be legible, and the notes should be clearly referenced to the appropriate part of the lab. You will be informed when yoshouldst makenry entry in your logbook.
