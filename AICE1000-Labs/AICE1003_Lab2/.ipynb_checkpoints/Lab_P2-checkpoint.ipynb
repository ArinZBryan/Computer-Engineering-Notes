    "### 1.1. Aims and Learning Outcomes\n",
    "This laboratory aims to:\n",
    "- Understand loops and how to use them\n",
    "- Understand functions, how to define and call functions\n",
    "- Understand lists and operations on lists including list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you complete this laboratory, you will be to:\n",
    "- Write a simple program using loops to model repetitive behaviours\n",
    "- Write a program with functions to have better code structures with correct type annotations.\n",
    "- Utilise the list data structure and use operators to update lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Schedule\n",
    "- Preparation Time: 1 hour\n",

As such, it should be legible, and the notes should be clearly referenced to the appropriate part of the lab. You will be informed when yoshouldst makenry entry in your logbook.
